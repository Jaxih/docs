# Subscription Types

There are two subscription types 

- **Standard Subscription** - you can subscribe on the [RCL Website](https://rclapp.com) , payments are handled through PayPal. This subscription is ideal for users creating stand alone TLS/SSL certificates. Users can use a REST API or custom applications to automate certificate renewal. 

- **Azure Marketplace Subscription** - you can subscribe in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/rayconsulting.002?tab=overview), payments are handled through Microsoft. This subscription is ideal for users wishing to automate TLS/SSL certificate creation and renewal using an Azure DNS Zone. It is also ideal for installing certificates in Azure App Services and Key Vault.
